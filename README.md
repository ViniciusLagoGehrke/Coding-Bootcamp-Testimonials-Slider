## The Challenge

In this challenge I built a testimonial slider and git it looking as close to the original design as possible.

For this challenge I used React, Typescript and Styled-components, and created a Slider component to change from one testimonial to another.

The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## What I learned and praticed In this challenge besides the basic of HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

 - Slider functionality from mouse/trackpad or keyboard;
 - Create React components
